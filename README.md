# upwork-search-by-zipcode
WordPress Plugin to locate franchise by Zip Code. Huge Databases added on a Settings Page.

This Plugin was Developed as part of the interview for the Upwork Premium Freelancer Program.

The Plugin takes two Huge Databases and map information from both of them to obtain information about a franchise with a Zip Code. The challenge of this project was that the size of one of the databases was too huge that exahusted the memory of the process of WordPress. The solution was not to load the database at once on an array, but to take each line of the CSV and find the desired franchise.
